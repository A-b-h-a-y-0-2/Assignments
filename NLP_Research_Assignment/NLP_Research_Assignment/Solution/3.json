    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nSubjective:\nMr. Paul Henderson, a 67-year-old male, came in today reporting increased urinary frequency and nocturia over the past three months. He states that he typically wakes up three to four times at night to urinate, which has significantly impacted the quality of his sleep. He also mentions a weak urine stream, occasional dribbling, and a sensation that his bladder is not fully emptying. He denies any noticeable hematuria, burning sensation, or fever, and he has no known recent exposures to sexually transmitted infections.\n\nPast Medical History:\nMr. Henderson reports a history of borderline hypertension, managed with a low-salt diet and mild exercise. He denies any major surgeries or hospitalizations, with the exception of an appendectomy in his early 20s. He has never smoked, occasionally drinks wine on weekends, and works part-time as an accountant. He has no known family history of prostate cancer but mentions that his father had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVital signs are fairly normal: Blood pressure 128/82 mmHg, heart rate 78 bpm, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 98.4°F (36.9°C). Mr. Henderson is in no acute distress. On abdominal palpation, there is no significant tenderness. The genitourinary exam is deferred to a specialist per the patient’s preference. We discussed the likelihood that these symptoms could be due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or another issue. A digital rectal exam (DRE) was not performed at this time due to patient request for a referral to urology.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Laboratory Tests**: A PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) test is ordered to assess for possible prostate abnormalities. A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is also requested to evaluate kidney function.\n2. **Referral**: Mr. Henderson requested to see a urologist for further evaluation of his urinary symptoms, including a possible DRE.\n3. **Lifestyle Recommendations**: Advised limiting evening fluid intake to reduce nocturia, continuing mild exercise, and monitoring blood pressure.\n4. **Follow-up**: He is instructed to return in two weeks or sooner if he experiences any acute changes, such as hematuria or signs of infection (fever, painful urination, flank pain).\n\nAssessment:\nAt this juncture, the differential diagnosis leans strongly towards benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, an elevated PSA or abnormal findings on specialized examination may raise suspicion for prostate cancer or prostatitis. The referral to urology and the PSA test are key next steps in determining the cause of his lower urinary tract symptoms.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson understands the importance of evaluating his complaints promptly. Early detection of any prostate-related issues, whether benign or malignant, can significantly influence management and outcomes. He will follow up with the recommended tests and specialist consult.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nPresenting Complaint:\nMr. Henderson was referred to urology for an evaluation of his urinary symptoms, notably increased frequency, nocturia, and a weak stream. At today’s appointment, he reports these issues remain bothersome but have not dramatically worsened since his last primary care visit.\n\nDetailed History:\nMr. Henderson confirms no episodes of gross hematuria, fever, or chills. He still sleeps poorly due to multiple nighttime awakenings for urination. His mild hypertension remains stable, and he follows a low-salt diet. He denies any known medication changes or new supplements since his last visit.\n\nPhysical Exam:\n1. **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure 130/84 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, temperature 98.1°F, respiratory rate 16/min. Overall stable.\n2. **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)**: The prostate is approximately moderately enlarged. On palpation, it feels firm and asymmetric in certain areas. There is a discernible nodule on the right side, which raises concern for possible malignancy. No significant tenderness is noted, which makes acute prostatitis less likely.\n3. **Abdominal Exam**: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses. No costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\nLaboratory Results Review:\n- **PSA**: Recently measured at 6.8 ng/mL (normal is typically considered up to ~4.0 ng/mL for his age group, but can vary by guidelines). This mild to moderate elevation is concerning when correlated with the DRE findings.\n- **BMP**: Within normal limits, indicating stable renal function.\n\nAssessment:\nThe presence of a prostatic nodule on DRE, combined with an elevated PSA, increases the suspicion for prostate cancer. Differential diagnoses still include benign prostatic hyperplasia with focal nodular changes, or possibly a low-grade prostatitis, but malignancy must be ruled out.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) and Prostate Biopsy**: Recommended to obtain definitive histological diagnosis. This will help ascertain the presence or absence of malignant cells and guide further staging.\n2. **Imaging**: A pelvic MRI may be considered if the biopsy suggests high-grade disease or if we need better visualization of local extension.\n3. **Patient Education**: Discussed the purpose and procedure of a TRUS-guided biopsy, including potential side effects such as bleeding, infection, or discomfort.\n4. **Follow-up**: We will schedule a biopsy within the next two weeks. Mr. Henderson was reminded to report any new or worsening urinary symptoms, fevers, or difficulty voiding.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile the exam findings do not definitively confirm cancer, they warrant a prompt biopsy. Mr. Henderson agrees with proceeding, understanding the significance of early detection and accurate diagnosis.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nProcedure Date: 03/25/2025\nUrologist: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nPre-Procedure Notes:\nMr. Henderson arrived at the outpatient urology center for a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. He received counseling regarding the procedure, possible risks such as bleeding, infection, and transient urinary retention, and was given prophylactic antibiotics (a fluoroquinolone) an hour before the biopsy to minimize infectious complications. He denies any allergies and confirmed he had not taken anticoagulants for at least one week, per instructions.\n\nProcedure Steps:\n1. **Positioning and Preparation**: Mr. Henderson was placed in a left lateral decubitus position. A transrectal ultrasound probe was gently introduced.\n2. **Ultrasound Findings**: The prostate measured approximately 45 cc in volume, larger than the typical average of 20–30 cc, consistent with BPH. However, there was a hypoechoic lesion in the right peripheral zone correlating with the suspicious nodule found on DRE.\n3. **Biopsy**: Using an 18-gauge biopsy gun, 12 core samples were systematically obtained from the peripheral zones of the prostate, including extra cores in the area of the hypoechoic lesion. Mr. Henderson tolerated the procedure with minimal discomfort, reporting only slight pressure and mild stinging during sampling.\n4. **Hemostasis and Post-Care**: Minimal bleeding was noted. Hemostatic pressure was applied briefly, and no immediate complications were observed. Mr. Henderson was then monitored in the recovery area for 30 minutes.\n\nImmediate Post-Procedure Status:\nMr. Henderson reported mild rectal soreness but no significant pain. He was able to urinate without difficulty. He received instructions to watch for hematuria, rectal bleeding, or signs of infection, such as fever or chills. He was advised to increase fluid intake and continue prophylactic antibiotics for the prescribed course.\n\nPlan:\n- **Pathology**: The 12 core samples were sent to the pathology lab for histopathological examination, including Gleason scoring if malignant cells are found.\n- **Follow-up**: A urology clinic appointment is scheduled in 7–10 days to discuss biopsy results. Mr. Henderson was instructed to call sooner if he experiences concerning symptoms (e.g., difficulty urinating, significant bleeding, or fever).\n\nConclusion:\nThe TRUS-guided prostate biopsy was performed without immediate complications. The suspicious lesion was adequately sampled. The pathology report will clarify whether Mr. Henderson’s elevated PSA and abnormal DRE are indicative of prostate cancer or another pathology. Early detection remains crucial for optimal management and prognosis.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Report: 04/03/2025\nPathologist: Dr. William Archer\n\nSpecimens:\nTwelve core biopsy samples from the prostate, labeled according to standard sextant mapping with additional targeted cores in the right peripheral zone.\n\nMicroscopic Examination:\n1. **Right Peripheral Zone Cores**: Malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The glands are crowded and demonstrate prominent nucleoli. Based on the Gleason grading system, the dominant pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, yielding a Gleason score of 3+4 = 7.\n2. **Other Cores (Left Peripheral, Base, Apex)**: Several cores show benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic inflammatory changes. No malignancy identified in these regions.\n\nTumor Characteristics:\n- In the malignant cores, the extent of involvement ranges from 30% to 60% of the tissue examined.\n- Perineural invasion is noted, commonly seen in prostate cancer but does not necessarily indicate extraprostatic extension.\n- No definitive evidence of high-grade (Gleason pattern 5) disease in the submitted samples.\n\nDiagnosis:\nProstatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 7 (3+4), primarily involving the right peripheral zone.\n\nComments:\nA Gleason score of 7 (3+4) indicates an intermediate-grade prostate cancer. Further staging assessments, including imaging and serum markers, may help determine if the disease is organ-confined. Additional data such as PSA density or genomic tests could refine risk stratification. The presence of perineural invasion can correlate with a slightly higher likelihood of extraprostatic extension, but imaging is required to confirm.\n\nRecommendation:\nCorrelate these findings with clinical and radiologic staging. Consider discussing treatment options with the patient, which may include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or potentially active surveillance if certain criteria are met (though many would treat Gleason 7 more definitively).\n\nSigned:\nDr. William Archer, MD\nDepartment of Pathology, Hillside Labs\nReport Date: 04/03/2025\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson’s biopsy confirms prostate cancer in the right peripheral zone with an intermediate Gleason score. Multidisciplinary evaluation with urology, radiation oncology, and possibly medical oncology will be necessary to formulate an optimal treatment plan.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 04/06/2025\nUrologist: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nChief Purpose:\nMr. Henderson returns to review his prostate biopsy results, which indicate a Gleason 7 (3+4) adenocarcinoma in the right peripheral zone. He states he has been anxious about the findings but is also eager to understand his treatment options.\n\nReview of Biopsy Results:\nDr. Turner explains that a Gleason 7 (3+4) is often considered intermediate risk, though it depends on how much pattern 4 is present and other clinical factors. The cancer appears localized to the right side based on the biopsy cores, and no cancer was detected in the left side. However, imaging will help confirm if there is any extension beyond the prostate capsule.\n\nFurther Workup:\n1. **MRI of the Prostate**: Recommended to evaluate local extension, if any, and confirm whether the tumor is organ-confined. This may influence decisions regarding nerve-sparing surgery.\n2. **Bone Scan**: Often performed in cases of higher PSA (>10 ng/mL) or higher Gleason scores. Mr. Henderson’s PSA is 6.8 ng/mL, borderline for routine scanning, but Dr. Turner believes a baseline bone scan may be prudent to rule out occult metastases.\n\nTreatment Options (Preliminary Discussion):\n- **Radical Prostatectomy**: Surgical removal of the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. This can be performed via an open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted approach. Potential risks include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, although nerve-sparing techniques can help preserve function.\n- **Radiation Therapy**: External beam radiation or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be options. Side effects can include urinary irritation, rectal discomfort, and sexual dysfunction.\n- **Active Surveillance**: Typically more suitable for low-risk (Gleason 6) disease; given a Gleason 7, many clinicians recommend a definitive treatment rather than surveillance, but some patients with favorable 3+4 and other low-risk features might still consider it.\n\nPatient Counseling:\nMr. Henderson was encouraged to consider his overall health status, personal preferences, and tolerance for possible side effects. Dr. Turner emphasized the importance of a thorough staging process before finalizing a plan. Mr. Henderson voiced concern about preserving sexual function and urinary control but understands the priority of controlling the cancer.\n\nPlan:\n- Order a prostate MRI and bone scan.\n- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review imaging results and finalize treatment decisions.\n- Provide patient education materials on surgical and radiotherapy options.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson remains an excellent candidate for curative-intent therapy given his apparently localized disease. Confirming organ confinement through imaging is the next crucial step. He will return after completing the recommended scans.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 04/20/2025\nUrologist: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nObjective:\nMr. Henderson underwent a multiparametric MRI of the prostate and a bone scan over the past week to complete staging for his Gleason 7 (3+4) prostate adenocarcinoma. He returns today to review the results. He reports no significant changes in urinary symptoms since his last visit. He remains anxious about the possibility of spread but is hopeful for localized disease.\n\nImaging Findings:\n1. **Prostate MRI**: A well-defined lesion in the right peripheral zone measuring approximately 1.6 cm. It appears to be confined within the prostatic capsule (Stage T2) without overt capsular bulge or seminal vesicle invasion. No suspicious lymph nodes are seen in the pelvis. The imaging suggests a localized tumor consistent with T2 disease.\n2. **Bone Scan**: No evidence of focal bony lesions indicating metastasis. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine, which are not suspicious for cancer.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on these imaging findings, Mr. Henderson’s disease is likely clinically staged as T2 N0 M0, which correlates with a stage consistent with organ-confined or at least regionally limited prostate cancer. This staging suggests he is a good candidate for definitive local therapy, such as surgery or radiation.\n\nPlan for Treatment:\nDr. Turner reaffirms two primary curative approaches:\n- **Radical Prostatectomy** (Open or Robotic-Assisted): Typically recommended for men with a life expectancy beyond 10 years and localized disease. This could be combined with pelvic lymph node dissection, given his intermediate risk. Potential side effects discussed again include erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and typical surgical risks.\n- **Radiation Therapy**: External beam radiation therapy over several weeks or brachytherapy. May be combined with short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) if considered necessary for intermediate-risk disease. Side effects can include urinary frequency, dysuria, and bowel-related issues like proctitis.\n\nPatient Discussion:\nMr. Henderson states that he wants to be aggressive in treating the cancer and is inclined towards surgery. He has concerns about urinary incontinence but acknowledges that modern techniques may help preserve function. Dr. Turner suggests that he also speak with a radiation oncologist to fully understand all options. They review basic guidelines indicating that Gleason 7 disease typically warrants definitive therapy unless significant comorbidities preclude aggressive management.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Refer to a radiation oncology consult if the patient desires a second opinion.\n- If Mr. Henderson proceeds with surgery, schedule preoperative labs, EKG, and anesthesia consultation.\n- Begin pelvic floor exercises preoperatively to help with post-surgery continence.\n\nConclusion:\nThe imaging results are reassuring for localized disease. Mr. Henderson is leaning toward radical prostatectomy, given his relatively good health and preference for a single definitive procedure. Final decisions will be made after any additional consultations.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 05/02/2025\nRadiation Oncologist: Dr. Linda Zhao\n\nReason for Consultation:\nMr. Henderson, who has a confirmed Gleason 3+4=7 prostate adenocarcinoma (Stage T2 N0 M0), is evaluating all treatment options. Although he is leaning toward radical prostatectomy, he wished to discuss the possibility of radiation therapy before making a final decision.\n\nClinical History:\n- Diagnosed via TRUS-guided biopsy with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.\n- PSA level of 6.8 ng/mL.\n- MRI shows a localized lesion in the right peripheral zone without extracapsular extension.\n- Bone scan is negative for metastatic disease.\n\nDiscussion of Radiation Options:\n1. **External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)**: Typically administered over 7–8 weeks (about 35–40 fractions) for localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Advances in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can target the prostate precisely, sparing normal tissues.\n2. **Brachytherapy (Seed Implant)**: Involves placing radioactive seeds (commonly I-125 or Pd-103) directly in the prostate. This may be considered alone for lower-risk patients or in combination with EBRT for certain intermediate-risk cases.\n3. **Side Effects**: Dr. Zhao explains possible urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, and rare but potential bowel complications like proctitis. Erectile dysfunction can occur but may be less immediate compared to surgery, sometimes manifesting gradually.\n4. **Hormone Therapy (ADT)**: Short-term androgen deprivation (4–6 months) is sometimes added for intermediate-risk disease to enhance the effectiveness of radiation, though it’s not universally required. ADT can cause hot flashes, reduced libido, and bone density changes.\n\nPatient Concerns and Preferences:\nMr. Henderson inquires about the probability of needing ADT and how it might affect his energy levels and sexual function. Dr. Zhao clarifies that for Gleason 7 disease, some protocols do add short-course ADT. However, each case is individualized, and not all intermediate-risk patients require it if the tumor volume is relatively small and imaging shows no extraprostatic extension.\n\nPlan:\n- If Mr. Henderson opts for radiation, a CT simulation and MRI fusion would be the next step to precisely map the prostate and adjacent structures.\n- He is encouraged to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of surgery versus radiation. Both have high cure rates in localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer, though the side effect profiles differ.\n- Dr. Zhao advises an informed decision after considering quality of life, personal preference, and risk tolerance.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson expresses gratitude for the thorough explanation. He will consult with Dr. Turner (urology) again before making a final choice. He acknowledges that either surgery or radiation can be curative, and his decision will revolve around which side effect profile he finds more acceptable.\n"

He is here for a thorough preoperative evaluation, including medical clearance from anesthesia, lab tests, and imaging.\n\nAssessment:\n1. **Medical History Review**: Hypertension is controlled with diet, no evidence of cardiovascular disease. No known prior surgeries aside from an appendectomy. Denies any medication allergies.\n2. **Physical Exam**: Blood pressure 126/80 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, respiration rate 16/min, temperature 98.5°F. Cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No peripheral edema or stigmata of chronic disease.\n3. **Laboratories**: CBC, CMP, coagulation profile, and type/crossmatch if needed for potential blood transfusion. Basic labs from 05/08/2025 were largely within normal range. Hemoglobin 14.2 g/dL, WBC 6.2 K/µL, Platelets 210 K/µL, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL.\n\nAnesthesia Consult:\n- **EKG**: Shows normal sinus rhythm, no ischemic changes. \n- **ASA Classification**: Likely ASA II (mild systemic disease, controlled hypertension). This rating means mild risk for anesthesia. The anesthesiology team will discuss the possibility of general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation. Postoperative pain control may include nerve blocks, IV opioids, or oral medications.\n\nCounseling on Procedure and Recovery:\n- **Surgical Plan**: A robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, possibly nerve-sparing if feasible on the right side. Pelvic lymph node dissection might be performed if intraoperative findings suggest increased nodal risk.\n- **Risks**: Bleeding, infection, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, injury to surrounding structures (e.g., rectum, bladder neck). There’s also the risk of anesthetic complications like aspiration or arrhythmias, though low in a patient with stable cardiovascular status.\n- **Postoperative Course**: Typically includes a short hospital stay (1–2 days), followed by catheter management for 7–10 days. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help with continence. Erectile function recovery varies; nerve-sparing techniques aim to preserve potency.\n\nPlan:\n- Patient to arrive the evening before surgery for final labs and NPO (nothing by mouth) instructions.\n- Reinforce that he must not eat or drink after midnight to ensure a safe anesthesia induction.\n- Confirm prescription for postoperative analgesics and prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson has met all the criteria for surgical clearance. He understands the procedure, risks, and expected recovery timeline. The next step is admission on the scheduled date for the robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. He exhibits a positive attitude, and his vital signs and labs are stable.\n"

Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy\n2. Bilateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection\n3. Nerve-Sparing Technique Attempted on Left Side, Partial on Right\n\nOperative Details:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lithotomy position with a steep Trendelenburg tilt. Six small trocars were inserted for the robotic instruments and camera. The anterior peritoneum over the bladder was incised, and the prostate was visualized. Careful dissection was performed to separate the prostate from the bladder neck and urethra. The neurovascular bundles were identified; full nerve-sparing was feasible on the left side, but on the right side, partial nerve-sparing was performed due to proximity to the known lesion.\n\nHemostasis:\nMinimal blood loss, estimated at approximately 200 mL. No transfusions required. The pelvic lymph nodes were dissected bilaterally, and multiple lymph nodes were sent for pathological analysis.\n\nClosure:\nThe bladder neck was re-anastomosed to the urethra using a running suture. A urinary catheter (Foley) was placed for postoperative drainage. Trocars were removed, and the small incisions were closed with sutures.\n\nComplications:\nNo intraoperative complications noted. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, with no significant fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nPostoperative Plan:\n1. Transfer to the PACU for close monitoring. Anticipated hospital stay is 1–2 days.\n2. Foley catheter management for 7–10 days postoperatively.\n3. Pain control with IV opioids and NSAIDs, converting to oral analgesics as tolerated.\n4. Await final pathology of the prostate specimen and lymph nodes to confirm the extent of disease.\n\nConclusion:\nThe robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy was completed successfully with partial nerve-sparing on the right side. Mr. Henderson tolerated the procedure well and will be closely observed during the immediate postoperative period. The final pathology report will guide any need for additional therapies such as radiation or hormonal treatment.\n"

Multiple tissue sections were taken from the right peripheral zone, apex, base, and the left side for histologic examination. Additionally, 10 lymph nodes from the bilateral pelvic dissection were included.\n\nMicroscopic Findings:\n1. **Primary Tumor**: Confirmed adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4), occupying approximately 30% of the prostate volume. The lesion is predominantly in the right peripheral zone, consistent with the biopsy findings. \n2. **Extracapsular Extension**: No definite evidence of capsular breach or seminal vesicle invasion. The tumor appears confined within the prostate, correlating with T2 classification.\n3. **Surgical Margins**: All margins are free of tumor.

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 05/30/2025\nAttending Surgeon: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nChief Reason:\nMr. Henderson presents for a postoperative evaluation approximately two weeks after his robotic radical prostatectomy. He reports mild incisional discomfort and occasional leakage around the catheter, but otherwise feels well. Today’s visit includes a plan to remove the Foley catheter and discuss final pathology findings.\n\nSubjective:\nHe states that his pain is managed with over-the-counter acetaminophen. He notices occasional bladder spasms, but they are tolerable. Bowel movements are regular, with no constipation or diarrhea. He has been doing short walks daily and some light pelvic floor exercises as instructed.\n\nPhysical Exam:\n1. **Vitals**: Blood pressure 125/78 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 98.6°F. No acute distress.\n2. **Incisions**: The small trocar incision sites are healing well without redness or drainage. No evidence of herniation or infection.\n3. **Catheter**: Minimal hematuria in the bag. The catheter is intact with no obvious obstruction.\n\nDiscussion of Pathology:\nDr. Turner reviews the pathology report confirming organ-confined disease (pT2 N0) with negative margins. No extension beyond the prostate capsule and no lymph node involvement are especially favorable. Gleason 7 (3+4) indicates intermediate-grade cancer, but the negative margins significantly improve prognosis.\n\nCatheter Removal:\nThe Foley catheter is gently removed in the clinic. Mr. Henderson is instructed to drink fluids and attempt urination before leaving. Dr. Turner explains that some degree of stress incontinence or dribbling is common initially, and consistent pelvic floor muscle training is crucial.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Urinary Continence**: Encourage Kegel exercises to improve pelvic floor strength. Provide written instructions if needed.\n2. **Erectile Function**: Nerve-sparing was partial on the right side, so rehabilitation may involve PDE5 inhibitors once healing is established, typically after 4–6 weeks if no contraindications.\n3. **PSA Monitoring**: Obtain a baseline postoperative PSA at 6 weeks, then every 3–6 months. A rising PSA could indicate biochemical recurrence, prompting further evaluation or salvage therapy.\n4. **Physical Activity**: Gradually increase walking and light household activities. Avoid heavy lifting (>10 lbs) for at least another 2–4 weeks.\n5. **Follow-up Appointment**: In approximately one month to assess urinary function, wound healing, and overall recovery.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson’s surgical outcome is favorable, with pathology confirming organ-confined disease and clear margins. He is now catheter-free and will focus on pelvic floor strengthening to regain urinary continence. The next critical step is postoperative PSA surveillance to ensure ongoing remission.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 06/15/2025\nUrology Clinic\n\nSubjective:\nMr. Henderson is now one month post-robotic radical prostatectomy. He reports gradual improvement in urinary control, though he still experiences mild leakage during coughing or sneezing. He uses one to two protective pads daily. Regarding erectile function, he notes partial erections but not sufficient for intercourse. He has some concerns about long-term recovery of sexual function but understands nerve-sparing was partial.\n\nObjective:\n1. **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure 124/80 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, Temp 98.5°F, RR 16/min. Overall stable.\n2. **Pelvic Exam**: The trocar incisions are well-healed. There is no abdominal tenderness or palpable masses. \n3. **Urinary Assessment**: No sign of urinary retention or significant infection. He voids spontaneously with a moderate stream.\n\nDiscussion:\n1. **Continence**: Dr. Turner reassures Mr. Henderson that mild stress incontinence at one month is not unusual. Many patients see further improvement over the first 6–12 months post-prostatectomy. Kegel exercises can be continued.\n2. **Erectile Function**: PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil or tadalafil) are options for penile rehabilitation, often started around one month post-op if there are no contraindications. Early rehabilitation can help preserve blood flow and encourage nerve recovery. \n3. **PSA Test**: The first postoperative PSA at 6 weeks returned at <0.1 ng/mL, indicating an undetectable level thus far, which is a positive sign for remission.\n\nPlan:\n- Continue pelvic floor exercises daily.\n- Start a low-dose PDE5 inhibitor for penile rehabilitation if Mr. Henderson is amenable, to be taken a few times per week. Dose to be determined by blood pressure and other factors.\n- Maintain follow-up schedule: Repeat PSA in 3 months. Follow-up visit in 2–3 months for further assessment.\n- Advise caution with strenuous exercise or heavy lifting for at least another month, but encourage walking and gentle aerobic activity.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson is progressing well at one month post-surgery, with typical mild stress incontinence and partial erectile function. An undetectable PSA is reassuring for oncologic control. With continued pelvic floor exercises and possible PDE5 inhibitor therapy, further improvements in urinary and sexual function are anticipated.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 07/30/2025\nUrologist: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMr. Henderson is three months post-robotic radical prostatectomy for a Gleason 7 prostate cancer. He reports further improvement in urinary continence, now using just one pad a day for occasional leakage during physical exertion. He also notes incremental progress in erectile function with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, although spontaneity remains limited. He denies any significant pelvic pain or hematuria.\n\nObjective:\n1. **Vital Signs**: BP 120/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, Temp 98.4°F, RR 16/min, stable.\n2. **Physical Exam**: Abdomen soft, no tenderness. Surgical sites have healed well. No evidence of inguinal herniation. Genital exam is unremarkable apart from mild scrotal sag, which is within normal variation.\n3. **Laboratory**: A PSA test drawn last week shows <0.1 ng/mL, remaining undetectable.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Henderson’s postoperative PSA levels continue to be undetectable, suggesting excellent oncologic control at this juncture. His urinary symptoms are improving steadily, and with ongoing pelvic floor exercises, he is optimistic about regaining full continence. The partial nerve-sparing approach on the right side poses some limitations, but PDE5 inhibitors are aiding in better sexual function.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Surveillance**: Continue quarterly PSA testing for the first year. If consistently undetectable, the frequency may decrease to every 6 months in subsequent years.\n2. **Rehabilitation**: Encourage daily Kegel exercises, moderate aerobic activity, and PDE5 inhibitor use. If erectile function remains suboptimal, consider vacuum erection device or intracavernosal injections as a second-line option.\n3. **Lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet and healthy weight to support cardiovascular health, which is also essential for sexual function. Blood pressure remains well-controlled, so no changes in management are necessary.\n4. **Next Appointment**: In 3–4 months unless new issues arise, or if there is any concern about urinary retention, incontinence, or sexual function. \n\nConclusion:\nAt this three-month mark, Mr. Henderson demonstrates positive recovery trends in both continence and erectile function. His PSA remains undetectable, indicating no biochemical signs of recurrence. Ongoing supportive care and routine monitoring remain critical to ensuring sustained remission and quality of life.\n"

    "docText": "Patient Name: Paul Henderson\nDate of Birth: 03/12/1958\n\nDate of Visit: 09/15/2025\nUrologist: Dr. Melissa Turner\n\nSubjective:\nMr. Henderson is now six months post-radical prostatectomy for his Gleason 7 prostate cancer. He reports only rare episodes of urinary leakage (less than one pad daily), typically with strenuous activity. He notes further improvement in sexual function, though still not fully back to pre-surgery levels. He has adhered to PDE5 inhibitor therapy and pelvic floor exercises. Overall, he feels healthy and remains active with daily walks and light weightlifting.\n\nObjective:\n1. **Vitals**: Blood pressure 118/76 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, temp 98.3°F, respiratory rate 16/min. Stable and within normal ranges.\n2. **Physical Exam**: Abdomen non-tender, no incisional hernias, no suspicious lymphadenopathy in the groin or supraclavicular areas. Genital exam is unremarkable; scrotum and penis normal. \n3. **PSA Value**: Lab from 09/13/2025 shows PSA <0.1 ng/mL, consistent with no biochemical recurrence.\n\nAssessment:\nThe consistent undetectable PSA results six months post-surgery strongly suggest effective local control of prostate cancer. His urinary and sexual function both demonstrate gradual recovery, which aligns with typical patterns for men undergoing nerve-sparing procedures. He does not exhibit any clinical signs of recurrence or metastasis.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Continued Surveillance**: Maintain PSA checks every 3–6 months for the next year. If levels remain undetectable, intervals may extend to every 6–12 months over the next few years.\n2. **Rehabilitation**: Continue PDE5 inhibitors and pelvic floor muscle training to maximize continence and erectile recovery. Consider additional therapies if plateaued function becomes a concern.\n3. **Lifestyle**: Mr. Henderson was encouraged to continue a healthy diet and regular physical exercise. No contraindications for moderate weightlifting, but advised to increase gradually.\n4. **Follow-up Appointment**: In 4–6 months, or earlier if any new urinary, sexual, or other health issues arise.\n\nConclusion:\nMr. Henderson’s progress at the six-month milestone is highly favorable. He experiences only minor stress incontinence and moderate but improving erectile function. His PSA remains consistently undetectable, indicating successful surgical management of his intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The current plan emphasizes ongoing surveillance, rehabilitation, and a healthy lifestyle to maintain his quality of life.\n"
