    "docText": "Patient Name: Lisa Bowman\nDate of Birth: 11/23/1967\n\nChief Complaint:\nMrs. Lisa Bowman presents today for an initial evaluation of a right breast lump that was identified during her annual physical exam in late December 2019. She reports feeling a palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast approximately four weeks ago, which prompted her primary care provider to order further imaging. A diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound performed on 12/28/2019 indicated a suspicious lesion measuring roughly 2.1 cm in diameter.\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMrs. Bowman, a 52-year-old female, has no prior history of malignancy. She reports intermittent tenderness in the right breast near the area of the lump, but denies any nipple discharge or changes in the overlying skin. There is no significant family history of breast cancer, although her paternal aunt had ovarian cancer at age 62. She is otherwise healthy, takes only a multivitamin, and exercises moderately three times per week. Her last menstrual period was at age 50, and she considers herself perimenopausal.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. Mild hypertension diagnosed three years ago, controlled with lisinopril.\n2. Seasonal allergies (allergic rhinitis).\n3. No previous hospitalizations or surgeries.\n\nSocial History:\n- Occupation: Elementary school teacher.\n- Non-smoker, occasional glass of wine on weekends.\n- Lives with her husband and two teenage children.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVital signs: BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 16/min, Temp 98.2\u00b0F, Weight 145 lbs, Height 5\u20195\u201d. Inspection of the right breast reveals no significant skin changes or dimpling. Palpation of the upper outer quadrant reveals a distinct, mobile mass measuring approximately 2 cm, firm in consistency. No axillary lymphadenopathy is noted on exam.\n\nAssessment and Plan:\n1. Suspicious right breast lump, imaging consistent with a probable malignancy.\n2. Recommend core needle biopsy to confirm histopathology.\n3. Additional baseline labs to be drawn (CBC, CMP, and possible tumor markers). Mammogram images will be reviewed in detail.\n4. Once pathology results are obtained, discuss treatment options including surgical intervention and potential adjuvant therapies.\n\nLaboratory Orders:\n--------------------------------------------------------\n| Test        | Reason                  | Status     |\n|-------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| CBC         | Baseline               | Ordered    |\n| CMP         | Baseline               | Ordered    |\n| CA 15-3     | Breast tumor marker    | Pending    |\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMrs. Bowman was counseled regarding the possibility of breast cancer, and she expressed understanding of the need for a biopsy. She will return to the clinic once the pathology results are available.\n",
